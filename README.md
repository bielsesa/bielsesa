### Hello! 🐱‍💻

Nice to meet you. I am Biel, a junior developer from Barcelona, Spain.
Welcome to my GitHub page!

よろしくおねがいします。

I still have a long way to go, but I'm trying to take each step carefully and get everything I can out of them. ☺
I strive to be able to work as a game developer at some point! 👾

- 🔭 I’m currently working on a mobile game and my portfolio webpage
- 🌱 I’m currently learning three.js and Unity
- 📚 Right now, I'm reading Flow by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi
- 📫 How to reach me: bielsesa@gmail.com, I promise I look my email everyday! Or at least almost everyday...
- 😄 Pronouns: They/Them (though I prefer He/Him in Spanish)
- 🌐 You can speak with me in English, Spanish, Catalan and I hope a bit of Japanese soon 😃

### A little bit more info about me...

* 🎮 I made a really small game in Superpowers HTML5 for my final project, which you can find on [itch.io](https://astronautpotato.itch.io/medical-showdown). It's full of errors but I was proud, since it was the first time I made a demo by myself.

* 👨🏻‍🎓 I've studied Web and Multi-platform app development in a Community College were I live, in Barcelona. Here it is called a Higher Technical Certificate. It consisted of a three-year-long course (it was actually two separate degrees, but since they share a lot of the prospectum, they joined them!).

* 🧪 I actually started studying Chemistry. I really love science and always wanted to become a researcher, but I'm also happy I decided to become a developer. And anyways, who knows what the future holds! ☺

* 🏳️‍⚧️ I am non-binary!
