### Hello! 🐱‍💻

Nice to meet you. I am Biel, a backend developer from Barcelona, Spain. I have almost 4 years of experience as a .NET developer, and sometimes when I have free time I like to try out other technologies 😊.
My dream is to be able to work in the game industry at some point.
Welcome to my GitHub page!

### More info about me

My full name is Biel Serrano Sánchez.
Currently, I am a backend developer at ERNI Spain, working on a project in the MedTech industry.

As I mentioned earlier, I have aprox. 4 years of experience in .NET development, as well as some experience (including in my current job) of WPF.
Apart from that, I have commercial experience with WinForms and Visual Basic 6 (though I consider it a bit of a dark past 😋).

I have two Higher Technical Certificates, for Web Development and Multi-platform app development.
I also started a CS degree and another grade centered in videogames, but could never finish them, due to life circumstances (mostly, I had to get out of home, and bills are expensive!).

Luckily, since I attended so many courses, I was able to get a glimpse of many technologies.
I had to create PHP webs, SOAP and REST APIs with Java, as well as worked with JavaScript and all its broad range of companions (TypeScript, Angular, React Native, GraphQL...).
And, though not as much as I would have liked, I also had the possibility of playing around with Unity.

### My "life" status?

- 🔭 I’m currently participating in the Patient73 game jam with some work colleagues 😄.
- 🌱 Related with my job, I'm trying to improve my software architecture skills, so as to have a more solid base in my programming.
- 📚 Right now, I'm reading Flow by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi
- 🌐 You can speak with me in English, Spanish, Catalan and a liiittle bit of Japanese (though I need to resume my JP studies...) 😃

### Some of my projects and other facts

* 🎮 I made a really small game in Superpowers HTML5 for my final project, which you can find on (beware of the sound 😅) [itch.io](https://astronautpotato.itch.io/medical-showdown). It's full of errors, but I was proud, since it was the first time I made a demo game all by myself.

* 🧪 I actually started studying Chemistry. I really love science and always wanted to become a researcher, but I am actually really happy I decided to become a developer.

* 🏳️‍⚧️ I am non-binary and transmasc! My pronouns are they/them (though I prefer he/him in Spanish 😋).
