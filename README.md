### Hello! 🐱‍💻

Nice to meet you. I am Biel, a backend developer from Barcelona, Spain. I have 4 years of experience as a .NET developer, and sometimes when I have free time I like to try out other technologies 😊.
My hobbies are game development and gaming, as well as tabletop games (D&D too).
Welcome to my GitHub page!

### More info about me

My full name is Biel Serrano Sánchez.
Currently, I am a backend developer at ERNI Spain, working on a project in the MedTech industry.

As I mentioned earlier, I have 4 years of experience in .NET development, as well as some experience (including in my current job) of WPF.
Apart from that, I have commercial experience with WinForms and Visual Basic 6.

I have two Certificates of Higher Education (Associate's Degrees, I'm not sure what the actual equivalent is at this point), about Web Development and Multi-platform App Development (desktop and mobile apps and a bit of embedded systems, with a specialization on Big Data and IoT).
I also started a CS degree and another grade centered in videogames, but could never finish them, due to life circumstances (mostly, I had to get out of home, and bills are expensive!).

Thanks to attending both multi-platform app and web courses, I was able to get a glimpse of many technologies.
I had to create PHP webs, SOAP and REST APIs with Java, as well as worked with JavaScript and all its broad range of companions (TypeScript, Angular, React Native, GraphQL...).
And, though not as much as I would have liked, I also had the possibility of playing around with Unity.

### Current position

In my current job, I'm able to participate in some ways on the design of new features, conduct code reviews and learn software architecture hand on hand.
Apart from that I'm just a .NET and WPF Developer.
I also conduct demos for the product owners. We follow the Agile methodologies as well as SCRUM.

### My "life" status?

- 🔭 I'm creating a small game in Godot about vending machines.
- 🌱 Related with my job, I'm trying to improve my software architecture skills, so as to have a more solid base in my programming.
- 📚 Right now, I'm reading 'El infinito placer de las matemáticas' by Alessandro Maccarrone (I'm not sure if it's only on Spain).
- 🌐 You can speak with me in English, Spanish, Catalan and a liiittle bit of Japanese (though I need to resume my JP studies...) 😃

### Some of my projects and other facts

* 💫 I recently created a [personal webpage with Next.JS](https://www.astronautpotato.com/), and hosted on Vercel.

* 🎮 I have an [itch.io page](https://astronautpotato.itch.io/) with some games made for game jams and small projects for my studies. Since it's my hobby, I'm trying to grow my itch.io page with more free games for now.

* 🧪 I actually started studying Chemistry. I really love science and always wanted to become a researcher, but I am actually really happy I decided to become a developer.

* 🏳️‍⚧️ I am non-binary and transmasc! My pronouns are they/them (though I prefer he/him in Spanish 😋).
